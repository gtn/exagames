There are 2 games to choose from currently:

* BrainGame: The goal is to answer questions correctly and help the scientist to reach his goal of flying into space!

* Exaclicks: As time goes by, an image becomes more and more visible and supports the student on picking the correct answers to the questions.

NOTE: The Exaclicks game type is configured within the exabis game activity. Any Images uploaded to this course (as resources or inside folders) can be used for the configuration of the questions.';

If you think you know enough, click “Stop”, the earlier you click “Stop” the higher your score will be. – But watch out!  If you click too early you might not yet see enough to answer the question!<br />3. Answer the pertaining question before time runs out.  You have 40 seconds to answer each question. You will get a higher score for more difficult questions and the faster you answer. Give a wrong answer and you will lose a life.<br />4. Keep on going until the end of the game<br />The questions will get more and more difficult. Be careful, you only have three lives. Only the most courageous and clever learners will be able to break the high-score. May the force be with you!';
