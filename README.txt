Exabis games for Moodle

The goal of this activity is to bring the aspect of game-based-learning into Moodle-courses. Yes, game-based-learning is much more than using some funny animations and yes, HTML 5 is cooler than Flash - but these are developments that we have made in the past and just want to share for the fun of it.
The way the acitivity works is that two of  our exagames are based upon quizzes given to students within a Moodle-course. This way exagames can be seen as another fun-way to acquire knowledge being an "enhancement" of quizzes.

Braingame
We started out with the “braingame” which basically reads out questions from quizzes. During the answering of questions there is a small animation (brain growing for given correct answers). The ultimate goal is to catapult the scientist into outer space – otherwise he drops into the ocean. Highscores are given back to Moodle-courses – we used the course-results block which is not supported under Moodle 2.x so far.

Exaclick
This year we have enhanced the activity with another game called exaclick. The principles were taken from an old television-show where tiles would cover up a whole picture and then would be uncovered one by one.  In our version this is also combined with Moodle-quizzes but in addition questions can be enhanced with a video or picture that can be covered with tiles. These questions can be categorized with difficulty-levels – the enhancement is done with an integrated Flash-based editor.

Regarding gameplay: after one recognizes the picture or video the stop-button is pressed and a question (it could be related to the picture) is then displayed which should be answered correctly. If the question answered incorrectly one heart is lost, three lost hearts equals to “game over”.
Bonus points (for a game-highscore) are given for the factor speed (the sooner the picture is recognized the more bonus-points are gained).

For exaclick to work you need to configure the questions that you have added to a test that the game is based upon.

1.	Upload some pictures and/or videos to a folder within your Moodle-course
2.	Create a test based upon a question bank
3.	Create a game using the activity “exabis games” and choosing “exaclick” from the pulldown-menu
4.	Configure your question in the tab “configure question”. Here you can choose a question. By clicking on the question a flash-based editor is opened. Insert a link to a picture or video that was previously uploaded.
5.	Save the question
6.	Continue configuring questions on different difficulty-levels.
7.	Have your students play the game – Highscores are displayed within the exabis games-activity.

Gamelabs.at
This is a mere embedding of a platform we have started to develop two years back. Here students can create individual games based upon the adventure-principle. Take a look at the game “Hallo Welt” to get a basic idea. The platform was financed by the Federal Austrian Ministry of Education and is free to use for everyone.

* exabis games - Disclaimer *

As with any customization, it is recommended that you have a good backup of your Moodle site before attempting to install contributed code.
While those contributing code make every effort to provide the best code that they can, using contributed code nevertheless entails a certain degree of risk as contributed code is not as carefully reviewed and/or tested as the Moodle core code.
Hence, use this block at your own risk.
